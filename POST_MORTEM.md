# SIMD Lockstep Post-Mortem: From "Fools SIMD" to Verified Truth

## 1. The "Fools SIMD" Discovery
During the initial verification of the Systolic Mesh instruction broadcast, a phenomenon termed "Fools SIMD" was identified. Follower cores appeared to be synchronized with the Leader, but execution traces revealed a deceptive failure mode:
*   **The Trap Deception**: Follower cores attempted to execute the `csrw 0x800` (SIMD Enable) instruction locally. In the default configuration, the `systolicSimdMode` CSR is only writable or has side-effects on the Leader core. This caused the Followers to trigger a Machine Mode trap.
*   **The Recovery Gap**: While the Leader initiated the SIMD payload, the Followers were occupied by the trap handler. They returned to their idle loops precisely as the Leader completed the payload, creating a superficial appearance of synchronization.
*   **The Silent Failure**: No memory was modified by the Followers during this period, as they were effectively trapped in an exception loop rather than executing the broadcasted stream.

## 2. Implementation Strategies (The Immediate Mitigation)

To achieve verified lockstep execution, several surgical modifications were applied to the Rocket Core and the software environment. These interventions bypassed standard pipeline dependencies to enable reliable instruction injection.

### A. Instruction Hijacking
The Followers' internal `ibuf` (Instruction Buffer) was bypassed. In `RocketCore.scala`, the team hijacked the `id_expanded_inst` and `id_raw_inst` signals to feed the broadcasted instruction directly into the Decode stage when `systolic_enable` is asserted. This ensures the core processes the Leader's stream regardless of its local Program Counter or Fetch state.

### B. Operand Mapping and Registry Control
Initial attempts saw Followers attempting to fetch operands from the Systolic Mesh registers. The implementation was refined to force Followers to use their local Register Files. This allowed broadcasted instructions (like `csrr t0, mhartid`) to correctly retrieve the local Hart ID and base addresses from each Follower's unique registers, even though the instruction itself originated globally.

### C. The Burst-Mode Synchronization (Temporal Redundancy)
The hardware's broadcast mechanism provides a single-cycle `valid` pulse per instruction. If a Follower core experiences a transient stall (e.g., a pipeline bubble from a local branch or a D-Cache hit/miss delay) during that specific cycle, it "misses" the instruction. 

To mitigate this without complex handshaking hardware, the implementation utilizes an **8-store burst**. By broadcasting each critical memory instruction eight times in succession, the Leader creates an 8-cycle "temporal window." Since the `sb` (store byte) operation is idempotent, a Follower that is stalled for up to 7 cycles will still successfully commit the instruction on the 8th cycle. This provides a robust margin against the 1-3 cycle jitters typical of the Rocket front-end.

### D. Pipeline Flush and Take-PC Masking
A critical challenge involved preventing Follower cores from "escaping" their assigned execution window.
*   **Take-PC Masking**: A hardware mask was applied to the `take_pc` signal for Followers. This prevents them from following the Leader's jump or branch instructions, ensuring they remain parked in their local spin-loops while their pipelines process the broadcasted instructions.
*   **Stability Trade-offs**: While a mask on `take_pc_mem_wb` (the definitive flush signal) provided the highest Follower stability, it introduced instability in the Leader core's UART/exception handling. The final implementation uses a surgical `take_pc` mask in the Decode stage, combined with a software-side "NOP Runway."

## 3. Memory Coherence and Layout
Parallel memory modification by un-synchronized cores often leads to false-sharing races. To resolve this:
*   **Cache-Line Isolation**: The result buffer was redesigned using a `padded_slot_t` structure, ensuring each core's target variable is isolated within its own 64-byte aligned cache line.
*   **Linker Section Alignment**: A dedicated `.shared_mem` section was defined in the linker script (`test.ld`) at a fixed, 4KB-aligned address. This bypassed compiler-driven relocation issues and guaranteed a stable memory map for all cores.

## 4. Analysis: Towards a "Clean" Architecture

The current implementation serves as a robust proof-of-concept but relies on software-side mitigations for hardware desynchronization. A production-grade architecture should address these via:

### i. Follower-Fetch Hardware
Instead of Decode hijacking, a cleaner approach would involve Follower-Fetch hardware. In this model, the Follower's Program Counter actually updates to match the Leader's PC during SIMD mode. This provides accurate `mepc` tracking and eliminates the need for `take_pc` masking.

### ii. Hardware Credit-Based Handshaking
The current reliance on 64-NOP gaps and 8-store bursts should be replaced by a hardware `systolic_ready` wire from Followers back to the Leader. Each Follower would acknowledge the completion of an instruction, and the Leader would stall its next broadcast until all acknowledgments are collected, ensuring cycle-perfect lockstep without timing guesses.

### iii. Vector-Aware Coherence
A clean architecture would treat the 4-core cluster as a single logical entity. By marking SIMD transactions with a unique identifier, the coherence manager could treat parallel writes as a single wide-vector operation, improving bandwidth and eliminating the need for manual cache-line padding.

## Conclusion
The implemented Proof of SIMD Lockstep undeniably demonstrates the ability of the Systolic Mesh to drive a quad-core cluster in parallel. By surgically decoupling the Fetch-Decode dependency and implementing robust memory isolation, the team has established a verified foundation for future hardware-accelerated SIMD development on the Rocket Chip.
